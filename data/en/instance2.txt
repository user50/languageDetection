The cc.mallet.optimize package centers around two interfaces, Optimizable and Optimizer. Optimizable has several sub-interfaces that define different classes of methods for optimization. Optimizable classes are stateful; they must store the current values of all parameters. The most commonly used optimizable sub-interface is Optimizable.ByGradientValue. Classes that implement this interface must provide methods for calculating the value of a specific function at the current parameter settings and for calculating the gradient of the function, with respect to the current parameter values. Note that this interface does not require the Hessian matrix of second derivatives, so the interface is appropriate for numerical methods that approximate the Hessian.
